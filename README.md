# Vanilla JS

First we are going to create our project folder and then run this command to initialize the project:

```js
npm init -y

```

Now lets setup a generic .gitignore using this command

```js
npx gitignore node
```

Now lets initialize the git repo and make our first commit

```js
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Inital commit";

```

The next thing to do is create a repo on github and copy and past the code that they provide for you.

```js
git remote add origin https://github.com/C5m7b4/vanilla-js-2.git

git push -u origin master
```

Now let's create a new branch and get started with things

```js
git checkout -b branch1

```

We are going to build a javascript single page application so I am suggesting we use webpack, so lets get that installed and then we can work on some dependencies:

```js
  npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
  npm install --save-dev prettier
```

now create a file in the root of the project called .prettierrc and give it this:

```js
{}
```

We also need to install webpack-dev-server to serve up our files

```js
npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server
```

Now we are going to create a public folder in our root and create an index.html, but we are also going to need to install one more package:

```js
npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin

```

We also need to add a start script to our package.json like so

```json
"start":"webpack serve --open"
```

For safe keeping, we will also create a src folder and add an index.js with a console comment letting us know that everything is ready to go.

Now, let setup the meat and potatoes of our config. We are going to create three webpack configs. The common one, one for development, and one for production

************************************

## branch 2

install MiniCssExtractPlugin

```js
npm install --save-dev mini-css-extract-plugin
```

add rule for .js file to webpack.config.js install babel-loader and @babel/preset-env

```js
npm install --save-dev babel-loader @babel/preset-env
```

Now let's add a rule to webpack config for css loading

```js
npm install --save-dev css-loader
```

Add styles.css and add a google font and setup our basic styling. We will also add a div tag to our index.html so our background will work.

************************************

## branch 3

Setup eslint

```js
npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-import
```

Now we want to see linting errors so we need one more plugin

```js
npm install eslint-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

And lets add a linting script to our package.json

```json
"lint": "eslint src/*.js"
```

Now let's make sure that eslint is working by creating an unused variable:
index.js:

```js
const unused = '';
```

So let's say that we don't like that the fact that the error is popping up on our main display, we only want the error to show up in the console, we can add this to the webpack config file:

```js
  devServer: {
    static: "./dist",
    port: 3007,
    ++compress: true,
    ++client: {
      overlay: false,
    },
  },
```

Let's remove our unused variable and make sure the error goes away.

************************************

## branch 4

Now let's just stub out our index.html and get is ready for some development using javascript

************************************

## branch 5

Now we are going to create some data in a file called data.js in our src folder

```js
export const data = [
  { id: 1, name: 'apple', price: 0.99, size: 'each', category: 'fruit' },
  { id: 2, name: 'bananna', price: 1.1, size: 'each', category: 'fruit' },
  { id: 3, name: 'grapes', price: 1.99, size: 'bundle', category: 'fruit' },
  { id: 4, name: 'apple', price: 0.89, size: 'each', category: 'fruit' },
  {
    id: 5,
    name: 'Dr. Pepper',
    price: 1.09,
    size: '12 oz',
    category: 'beverages',
  },
  { id: 6, name: 'Mt. Dew', price: 4.99, size: '12 pk', category: 'beverages' },
  { id: 7, name: 'Coke', price: 1.79, size: '2 Liter', category: 'beverages' },
  { id: 8, name: 'Pepsi', price: 1.79, size: '2 Liter', category: 'beverages' },
  { id: 9, name: 'Tic Tacs', price: 2.99, size: '12 oz', category: 'candy' },
  { id: 10, name: 'Snickers', price: 1.59, size: 'bar', category: 'candy' },
  { id: 11, name: 'Almond Joy', price: 1.69, size: 'bar', category: 'candy' },
];
```

Now we are going to set a placeholder for filteredData and create some state

We are also going to add a utils.js and create an isValid function to use all the time.

Then we are going to add a little style to our app so it looks nice

Then we are going to just do some console logs to test everything out.

************************************

## branch 6

Let's add some actual state to our application

************************************

## branch 7

Now we are going to create the logic and styles to display our data as a table on the site

************************************

## branch 8

Lets build a function that will grab unique values from our data, and dynamically display them in a select box on the site. This will allow us to filter our data in our table with dynamic generation using map and filter. These are foundational functional javascript paradigms.

************************************

## branch 9

Now lets build out our delete functionality
Dont forget to add this to the tr for the delete functionality

```js
id="tr-${id}"
```

We need to tr-${id} because we are taking a substring in the code

```js
deleteItem(+e.currentTarget.id.substring(3));
```

************************************

## branch 10

Now let's introduce the concept of currying a function so we can apply partial application to it to get some reuseability.

************************************

## branch 11

Let's modify the index.html a little bit first. Then we are going to calculate the cheapest item and dislay that to our users. Then we will add a little style to our project, followed by calculating and dislaying the most expensive item. This is going to go over the reducer function so that we have covered map, filter, and reduce, and well as currying functions.

************************************

## branch 12

Now let's introduce a new concept. Introducing Functional composition. We can take small functions that do just one thing and compose them together to do many things in a point free way. We can discuss point free programming, but it mostly just includes not passing arguments to functions. We let the composition pass the arguments. So, The first function takes in teh array of objects to operate on and then the output of that function becomes the input of the next function in the chain.

************************************

## branch 13

Here we are only going to add a formatMoney function and apply that to our table and then a totals to the grid for our prices.

************************************

## branch 14

We need to make a small modification to the price in the exercise to ensure that is is being treated as a number. Then we are going to wire up the Save Item butto with an event listener. Next we will create a function to create our categories. Lastly we will modify the css so that both select fields share the same styles.

************************************

## branch 15

Next up, let's create a way to clear the form after we save a new item. Then let's test out adding items to our grid.
