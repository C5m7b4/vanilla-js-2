# Vanilla JS

First we are going to create our project folder and then run this command to initialize the project:

```js
npm init -y

```

Now lets setup a generic .gitignore using this command

```js
npx gitignore node
```

Now lets initialize the git repo and make our first commit

```js
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Inital commit";

```

The next thing to do is create a repo on github and copy and past the code that they provide for you.

```js
git remote add origin https://github.com/C5m7b4/vanilla-js-2.git

git push -u origin master
```
